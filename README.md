 All Stock Analysis

Overview of Project

In this study we created a method that allows to Steve's parents to see the percentage of gain or loss over several years. 
We were able to create a flexible macro for running multiple stocks in different years. To the entire sistem we added a botton, 
in this way Steve's parents can run multiple analysis in a very fast way and the easy formatting of the results allow us to understand the trend very quickly.

Results

Using our new methods, became pretty obviously that the 2017 the percents of returns was much higher respect to 2018. 
Moreover the refactoring code allowed us to clean better the data from our first code due to the presence of more variant like the startingPrices,
EndingPrices and the Ticker volumes. As we can see in the pics the total results are the same in both analysis, 
but with our new method we have a much better understanting of the real trend, in much shorter time.

Summary

Nowdays, the use of VBA excel as a coding language has the advantage that with simply codes we can analyze many data in a relatively short time.
Unfortunately VBA is not used too much today, as it is a strict and inflexible language, and can only be adapted only to Excel.
In this study, we can stated that the Refacoring code is a much more complete way to study the Stock Analysis. 
The vantage of this method is that it is possible to analyzed thousands of stocks in a very short time to execute.
Our first methods ran in a avarage of 0.5 sec, our new methos is almost the double faster.
